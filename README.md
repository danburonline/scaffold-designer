# Anisotropic Scaffold Designer

A web-based design tool for students and researchers in neural tissue engineering. This application facilitates the creation and modification of anisotropic microstructure templates for scaffolds used to culture neural progenitor cells. The designs can be exported as 3D-printable files (STL) or 2D images (PNG) for documentation and fabrication.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this tool is to provide an intuitive interface for designing scaffolds with specific topographic cues. These cues are crucial for guiding neurite outgrowth, cell alignment, and overall tissue formation. By enabling rapid prototyping of various geometries, this tool supports research into how physical environments influence neural development.

The long-term vision is to use the diverse scaffold designs generated by this tool to create temporal datasets of tissue growth. These datasets will be invaluable for training generative foundation models for predictive tissue engineering.

## Key Features

-   **Extensive Template Gallery:** Choose from a wide variety of predefined microstructures, including anisotropic (e.g., Aligned Fibres, Dendritic, Wavy Channels) and isotropic (e.g., Honeycomb, Porous Network) patterns.
-   **Intuitive Parameter Tuning:** Use sliders to interactively adjust geometric properties like fibre spacing, pore size, channel curvature, and wall thickness.
-   **JSON Configuration:** View, copy, and edit the full set of design parameters in a JSON format for precise control, documentation, and sharing.
-   **Diffeomorphic Transformations:** Apply smooth, topology-preserving deformations (Twist, Pinch, Ripple) to create complex variations from base templates.
-   **Live 2D Rendering:** Instantly visualise a top-down view of your scaffold design on an HTML5 canvas.
-   **Export for Fabrication & Documentation:**
    -   **PNG:** Export high-resolution images for presentations and reports.
    -   **STL:** Generate 3D models ready for slicing and 3D printing.
-   **Local Design Archive:** Save your favourite designs directly in your browser's local storage for easy access and iteration.
-   **Randomised Variants:** Quickly generate diverse design variations with a single click to explore the design space.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** React
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Graphics:** HTML5 Canvas API for 2D rendering.

## How to Run

This is a client-side application with no server-side dependencies. To run it locally:

1.  Ensure all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `components/`, etc.) are in the same directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The application should load and be ready to use.

## How to Use the Application

1.  **Select a Base Template:** On the left panel, click on an icon to choose a starting microstructure.
2.  **Tune Parameters:** Use the sliders on the right panel to modify the geometric properties of the selected template. You can also edit the design's name.
3.  **(Optional) Apply Transformations:** Select a transformation type (e.g., 'Twist') and adjust its strength.
4.  **(Optional) Use JSON Editor:** For advanced control, modify the parameters directly in the JSON editor on the left and click "Apply JSON". You can also "Copy" the JSON to save it externally.
5.  **Save Design:** Click the "Save" button in the header and provide a name to store the current design in the "Design Archive".
6.  **Export:**
    -   Click "PNG" to download a 2D image of the canvas.
    -   Click "STL" to generate and download a 3D printable file. Note that STL generation for complex designs might take a few moments.
